# Ping Pong // Code Review 3 [Epicodus]

#### By Julian Alexander

## Explanation
_This application receives the user input in a numerical form and then returns all concurrent numbers up to the entered number, with the exception of numbers divisible by 3, 5 or 15. These numbers will be omitted with either ping, pong or ping-pong._


## What's it do?
_This app receives a number from a user, and then runs a function on that number to create an array of numbers from 1 through the input number, and then goes through that array of numbers with another function, changing anything divisible evenly by 3 to the word "ping", anything divisible evenly by 5 to the word "pong", and anything divisible evenly by 15 to the word "pingpong" (breath) and will display it for the user in the html, each number or word as a list element._

## Instructions
* _Clone the Github repo into your home directory_
* _Navigate to the directory using the console_
* _Extract the files and open them in atom (or equivilant)_
